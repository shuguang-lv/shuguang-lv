### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Shuguang LYU (Desmond)

I'm an introverted web programmer with a passion for creating intuitive UI/UX designs and compelling graphics. When I'm not coding, you might find me strumming my guitar or catching up on my favorite animated shows. I also enjoy jogging regularly and exploring topics related to philosophy and psychology in my free time.
